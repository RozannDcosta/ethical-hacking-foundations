# Five Stages of Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking follows a structured process used to understand how attackers approach systems so security weaknesses can be identified
and fixed responsibly.

---

## 1. Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is the initial stage where information about the target
is collected. This includes understanding the target’s environment,
publicly available details, and potential attack surfaces.

This stage can be passive (no direct interaction) or active
(direct interaction with authorization).

---

## 2. Scanning
Scanning involves identifying live systems, open ports, services,
and possible vulnerabilities within the target environment.

It helps determine how systems are exposed and which areas require
further security analysis.

---

## 3. Gaining Access
In this stage, identified vulnerabilities are used to gain unauthorized access to a system.

Ethical hackers perform controlled actions to prove the existence
of weaknesses without causing damage.

---

## 4. Maintaining Access
Maintaining access focuses on understanding how attackers could
retain control over a compromised system for an extended period.

This stage highlights risks such as privilege escalation and
persistence mechanisms.

## 5. Clearing Tracks
Clearing tracks involves studying techniques used by attackers to
hide their activities and avoid detection.

Learning this stage helps security teams improve logging,
monitoring, and incident detection capabilities.
