## Security Controls

### Information Assurance
 Information Assurance (IA) is the practice of protecting information and information systems by ensuring they remain:

Confidential – Only authorized people can access it

Accurate (Integrity) – The data isn’t altered or tampered with

Available – The system works when needed

Authentic – Users and systems are who they claim to be

Non-repudiable – Actions can’t be denied later (proof of activity exists)
#### Processes that help achieving IA: 
- Developing local policy, process, and guidance.
-  Designing network and user authetication strategy.
-  Identifying network vulnerabilities and threats (Vulnerability assessments outline the security posture of the network). 
- Idenfitying problems and resource requirements. 
- Creating plan for identified resource requirements. 
- Applying appropriate IA controls.
- Performing C&A (Certification and Accreditation) process of 
information systems helps to trace vulnerabilities, and implement safety measures.
- Providing information assurance training to all personnel in federal and private org.

### Defence in Depth
 Defense in Depth is a cybersecurity strategy where you use multiple layers of security controls so that if one layer fails, others still protect the system.
### Risk
 Risk can be defined as a probability of the occurrence of a threat or an event that may damage, or cause loss or have other negative impact either from internal or 
external liabilities. 
- Risk can be categorized as Low, Medium, High and Critical
- A Risk Matrix is a visual tool used to determine how serious a risk is.
  
| Impact ↓ / Likelihood → | Very Low | Low    | Medium | High     | Very High |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| Very High Impact        | Medium   | High   | High   | Critical | Critical  |
| High Impact             | Medium   | Medium | High   | High     | Critical  |
| Medium Impact           | Low      | Medium | Medium | High     | High      |
| Low Impact              | Low      | Low    | Medium | Medium   | High      |
| Very Low Impact         | Low      | Low    | Low    | Medium   | Medium    |

#### Risk Managment
 Risk managment is the procees of identifying(risks), evaluating, responding and implementing of controls to tackle risks. 
 #### Risk Managment Phases
 - Risk Identification - Identifing potential threats. 
 - Risk Assessment - Evaluateing the likelihood and impact of each risk to determine its severity.
 - Risk Treatment - Implementing appropriate controls on the risk
 - Risk Tracking - Continuous process of monitoring identified risks and evaluating mitigation effectiveness
 - Risk Review - Reassesing the risk profile, update status, and adjusting strategies.
 #### Threat Modeling
  Is a risk assessment approach for analyzing the security of an application by 
capturing, organizing and analyzing all the information that affects the security of an 
application. 
- Identify Objectives: Helps to determine how much effort needs to be put on subsequent steps
- Application Overview: Identify the components, data flows, and trust boundaries 
- Decompose Application: Find more relevant details on threats 
- Identify Threats: Identify threats relevant to your control scenario and context using the information obtained in steps 2 and 3 
- Identify Vulnerabilities: Identify weaknesses related to the threats found using vulnerability categories
