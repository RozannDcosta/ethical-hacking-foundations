# Overview

## Ethical Hacking
Ethical hacking is the authorized process of testing systems to identify security weaknesses before malicious attackers exploit them.

## CIA Triad 
- Confidentiality – Preventing unauthorized access: It ensures that data/systems is accessed by authorized individuals or systems.
- Integrity – Preventing unauthorized modification: It ensures that data(in any form) is not altered by authorized individuals or systems
- Availability – Ensuring systems remain accessible: It ensures that data, systems, and resources are accessible to authorized users whenever needed.
### Key Components
- Authentication & Authorization – Verifies the identity of a user or system (authentication) and determines their access rights to resources (authorization).
- Non-repudiation - Guarantees the sender cannot deny sending a message and Confirms the recipient cannot deny receiving a message.

## Types of Attacks
- Passive Attack
  - Passive attacks occur when an attacker intercepts or monitors communications and data but
does not modify, interrupt, or affect the system or its resources. The main goal is information gathering, such as stealing confidential data or traffic analysis. These attacks are generally hard to detect because they leave no trace on the system or network.
    #### Examples
    Footprinting,
    Sniffing,
    Eavesdropping,
    Network Traffic Analysis

- Active Attack
  - Active attacks involve deliberate modification, disruption, or destruction of data, resources, or communication systems by an attacker. These attacks often aim to compromise system integrity, violate availability, or manipulate information. Unlike passive attacks, active attacks are usually more detectable because they leave noticeable effects on the system.
    #### Examples 
    Network Threats
    - Dos/DDos
    - DNS/ARP Poisoning
    - Firewall and IDS attack
    - Man-In-The-Middle-Attack
    - Password-based attack
    - Session Hijaking
    ###
    Host Threats
    - Arbitrary Code Execution
    - Backdoor Access
    - Code Execution
    - Malware Attacks
    - Password Cracking
    - Privilege Escalation
    ###
    Application Threats
    - Broken session managmeent
    - Buffer Overflow
    - Cryptography Attacks
    - Injection Attack
    - Improper input validation
    - Improper error handling
    - Phishing
    - Security Misconfiguration
- Close-in Attacks
  - Close-in Attacks happens when the attack is porformed in close physical distance of the target.
    #### Examples
    Social Engineering 
- Insider Attacks
  - When the attack is performed by a trusted person
    #### Examples
    Planting backdoors
    
- Distribution Attacks
  - These type of attack occurs when the hardware or software is tampared at the source where its created
    #### Examples
    Modification during production
     
## Types of Hackers
- White Hat – Authorized security professionals (Ethical Hackers)
- Black Hat – Malicious attackers (cause damage/loss)
- Gray Hat – Unauthorized but non-malicious (but is still illegal)
- Script Kiddies - Inexperienced/Unskilled hacker which use readymade tools made by other hacker.
- Hacktivist - They hack for some political intention (to promote some political cause)
- State-sponsored hackers - Hackers employed or indirectly funded by the government
- Cyber Terrorists - Politically or ideologically motivated hackers conducting disruptive attacks (on computer systems) to induce fear, panic, or physical harm
